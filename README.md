# VaL-Lol-Rant-Precompiled-
A colorbot for Valorant made by pean which I reworked a lil bit. 
Precompiled two builds for now to avoid Sig ban for the lazy people who can't "change" some codes or make it "UD".
The mouse input is from a chinese driver. It's undetected as of now.
You need to disable Secure boot and enable Hyper V to get this working.
Just run either one of the build and setup your config according to your preference.
Have fun.
